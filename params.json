{"name":"Intermediate-stats","tagline":"Further stats for those that already know R and some of the basics","body":"This course is a follow-on course to our Introductory Statistics course, including some topics that have been suggested by previous attendees. This course assumes basic knowledge of statistics and use of R, which would be obtained from our Introductory Statistics Course and an Introduction to R for Biologists run at the Genetics department (or equivalent). The course will cover linear regression, ANOVA and non-parametric ANOVA. It will be a mixture of lectures and hands-on time using RStudio to analyse data.  By the end of this course you should be able to:\r\n\r\n    * Select an appropriate test for analysing data\r\n    * Analyse data using linear regression\r\n    * Check the assumptions of linear regression are met by the data\r\n    * Check the fit of the linear regression model to your data\r\n    * Know when linear regression is not appropriate and have an idea of which alternative method might be appropriate\r\n    * Analyse data using ANOVA\r\n    * Know how to check that the ANOVA assumptions are met by the data \r\n    * Know when to use which non-parametric version of ANOVA\r\n    * Analyse data using non-parametric ANOVA\r\n    * Know when you need to seek help with analysis as the data structure is too complex for the methods taught\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
